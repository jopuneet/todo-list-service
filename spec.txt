Backend Challenge: Todo List Service 📝

Objective
Design and implement a resilient backend service for managing a simple to-do list. The service
should be built with best practices in mind, focusing on code quality, testing, and clean API
design.

Core Functional Requirements
1. To-Do Item Attributes
Each to-do item managed by the service must have the following attributes:
- description: A string detailing the task.
- status: A string with one of three possible values: "not done", "done", or "past due".
- creation_datetime: The timestamp when the item was created.
- due_datetime: The timestamp by which the task should be completed.
- done_datetime: The timestamp when the item was marked as "done". This can be null.

2. RESTful API Endpoints
The service must expose a RESTful API to perform the following actions:
- Add an item: Create a new to-do item.
- Update an item's description: Change the text of an existing item.
- Mark an item as "done": Change an item's status to "done".
- Mark an item as "not done": Change an item's status back to "not done".
- Get an item: Retrieve the full details of a single to-do item.
- Get all "not done" items: Retrieve a list of all items with the status "not done". This endpoint should also include an option to fetch all items, regardless of their status. 

Business Logic & Constraints
- Automatic Status Update: The service must include a mechanism to automatically change an item's status to "past due" if its due_datetime is in the past and its status is still "not done".
- API Restriction: Once an item's status is "past due", it should become immutable. The service must forbid any changes to "past due" items via the REST API.

Technical & Non-Functional Requirements

Your implementation should:
- Be fully dockerized and runnable via Docker.
- Use an H2 in-memory database for data persistence.
- Contain a suite of automatic tests. We are more interested in your approach to testing
and the quality of tests rather than achieving 100% coverage.

Your implementation should not:
- Implement any form of user authentication or authorization.

Submission Guidelines
Your work should be submitted as a link to a Git repository that we can clone. The repository's README.md file must contain brief notes covering:
1. Service Description: A brief overview of your solution and any assumptions you made.
2. Tech Stack: The runtime environment, frameworks, and key libraries used.
3. How-To Guide: Simple, clear instructions on how to:
- Build the service.
- Run the automatic tests.
- Run the service locally using Docker.

Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:
- Alignment with Requirements: How well the solution meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
- Code Quality & Readability: The clarity, structure, and maintainability of your code.
- Best Practices: Your approach to handling potential edge cases and errors.
- Testing: The presence and quality of your automatic tests.
- Commit History: Your thought process as reflected in your git commit messages.
